# Delhi Climate Forecasting: Time Series Analysis and Modeling
*Project Overview*

This project focuses on forecasting Delhi's climate using advanced time series methods. The goal is to analyze and model historical climate data to predict future trends.

*Dataset*

The dataset spans from January 1, 2013, to April 24, 2017, with daily observations of four key features:

Mean Temperature: Average temperature for the day
Humidity: Relative humidity level
Windspeed: Average wind speed
Mean Pressure: Average atmospheric pressure
Time Series Analysis and EDA

Given the temporal nature of the data, time series techniques are employed for visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA). This includes:

Seasonality and Trends: Identifying recurring patterns and long-term trends in the data.
Decomposition: Breaking down the time series into its components (trend, seasonality, and residual).
Data Preparation for Modeling

*The data is prepared for modeling by:*

Feature Engineering: Creating additional features if necessary (e.g., lagged values, derived variables).
Data Splitting: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
Forecasting Methods

*Four forecasting methods are implemented:*

    Naive Forecasting: A simple baseline method that predicts the next value as the previous value.
    ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average): A statistical model that uses past values to predict future values.
    ETS (Exponential Smoothing): A statistical method that models the trend, seasonality, and residual components of the time series.
    Deep Learning (RNN and LSTM): Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are suitable for time series and sequential data. They can capture complex patterns and dependencies in the data.
    
Note: The choice of forecasting method depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired level of accuracy
